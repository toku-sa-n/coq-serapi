description:  """
SerAPI is a library for machine-to-machine interaction with the
Coq proof assistant, with particular emphasis on applications in IDEs,
code analysis tools, and machine learning. SerAPI provides automatic
serialization of Coq's internal OCaml datatypes from/to JSON or
S-expressions (sexps).
